ACT and SAT Standardized Testing Analysis 
##### Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook) of ACT and SAT Score with Per Capita Income from 2017. 
##### The combined dataset limited the analysis (due to a broad versus specific categorical breakdown of the information recorded).
##### For example, a student's ethnicity, gender, race, rural and/or urban cannot be determined.
